### Python code for efficient data extraction in preparation for GAPIT.

Python was used to extract relevant data from AraGWAS and GSEA data. 
The Python scripts transform the input data from the studies and creates output files that are later used for GAPIT.

After GAPIT, Python was used to create gene coexpression matrices and networks out of them.
